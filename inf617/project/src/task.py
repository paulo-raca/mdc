    Our problem handles 2 distinct inputs: sensor location and measurements.

    This Map-reduce job merges them both in a denormalized table, which is going to be used as input
    for all the tasks

    A simple approach would be to have both inputs share the same Key (sensor_id),
    and for each one key read all entries looking for the location and insert it in other entries with measurements.

    This works, but is a bit inneficient. Instead, I map location to the key "{sensor_id}.A" and the measurements to the key "{sensor_id}.B".
    Relying on the fact that a partitioner can be configured to send ensure both of these end on the same reducer, and the data is ordered on the reducer's input,
    I can efficiently insert the location in all measurements in a single pass.
